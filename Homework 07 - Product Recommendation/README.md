  - You can follow step-by-step from [python code](https://github.com/Tubsamon/BADS7105-CRM/blob/main/Homework%2007%20-%20Product%20Recommendation/6210422010_HW7_ProductRecommendation%20(1).ipynb) 
  - In the link has steps as below
      - Load libraries and data
      - Check missing data
      - Turn float into integer
      - Determine product association using apriori
      - List out rules
      - Generate network graph

### 3. Conclusion : 
  - From confidence and lift value, I found that people who buy 'คอลลาเจน' will also buy 'กระเป๋า', 'ชาบู' and 'โรตี'.
